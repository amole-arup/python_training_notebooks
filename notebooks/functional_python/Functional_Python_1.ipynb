    "## Mutable and Immutable Data Structures (collections)\n",
    "\n",
    "Python only has a few data structures that are truly immutable. However, a programmer can choose to write according to a functional paradigm by not modifying mutable structures after they are initialised. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Mutable Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard mutable data structures are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lists\n",
    "- Dictionaries\n",
    "- Strings\n",
    "- Objects with attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible not only to access the value of any member of a list (or dictionary), but also delete it or change it. It is also possible to add members to the list at any location. Because of this potential for change, mutable data structures cannot be used as keys in a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that objects defined by classes are mutable means that it is generally good to limit the use of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Immutable datatypes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tuples\n",
    "- Named Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "Elements of Tuples cannot be accessed but cannot be changed after creation of the tuple. Note that because they are immutable, they can be used as keys in a dictionary."

    "### NamedTuples\n",
    "\n",
    "NamedTuples are useful because they can act as classes, but remain as immutable. They are also faster and more compact than classes. If you want to use them, you have to import them because they are not part of the base module. Note that since they are mutable, they can be used as keys in a dictionary. It is not possible to define associated methods for these data types without converting them to a mutable form.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we can use NamedTuple to create a 3d cartesian coordinate with properties `X`, `Y` & `Z`. The namedtuple is provided with a name and a list of property names.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Point3D = namedtuple('point3d',['X', 'Y', 'Z'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, instead of a list, you can provide a single string containing them where the property names are separated by commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Point3D = namedtuple('point3d','X, Y, Z')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Having defined the data format, you can go on to create a point3d object (an instance).\n",

    "## List Comprehension\n",
    "\n",
    "List comprehensions are syntactic sugar for standard loops over iterables, such as tuples, lists or dictionaries - `for i in (3,6,1,9,3,2): `\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar constructions are avalable for generators and dictionaries. We will look at these later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "* Single line format (typically)\n",
    "* Does not require initialisation of an empty list\n",
    "* Can be used as part of a data pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "* Only for simple iterative processes that can be described by application of a single function (this can also be an advantage!)\n",
    "* They generate lists (mutable), rather than tuples (immutable), which does not match the functional programming paradigm. Nevertheless, the programmer can choose to treat the lists as immutable by not changing their contents(!). It is also an option to convert a list to a tuple by means of the `tuple()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Format for List Comprehension\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard format is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[function(variable) for variable in variable_list if conditional_function(variable)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the function can include branches (if-statements)\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be extended to multiple variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[function(variable_1, variable_2) for variable_1, variable_2 in zip(variable_list_1, variable_list_2)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparative Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus the following two approaches are functionally the same and produce the square of each list item. \n",

    "1. List to operate on:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "a_tuple = (3,6,1,9,3,2)\n",

    "for a in a_tuple:\n",
    "    result_list_1.append(a**2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "Some functions accept lambda functions as parameters, for example the sorting function `sorted()`. For example, if you have a collection of tuples, you can use a lambda function to specify the second item as the one to order the list with. Lamda functions can also be used to sort objects according to a certain object parameter (e.g. sort `person` objects by attribute `person.age`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the `sorted()` function returns a new list rather than modifying the original. This matches the functional paradigm (although it does return a list which is mutable when given a tuple). _By contrast, the `list.sort` function modifies the `list`, and cannot be used on tuples or dictionaries._"

    "The `map` function is for applying functions to every element of an iterable (such as a list or a dictionary). \n",

    "Note that `map()` follows the principle of \"lazy operation\". Rather than return the list (by carrying out all the operations), it returns a `map` object which is like a \"promise\" to carry out the work. This allows Python to optimise operations and reduce storage requirements. If you want to view the results of the operation you can use the `list()` or `tuple()` functions to actualise it. \n",
