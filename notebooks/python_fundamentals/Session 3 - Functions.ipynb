    "Principles of programming:\n",
    "* Keep it simple (KISS - 'keep it simple, stupid')\n",
    "* Avoid repetition (DRY - 'do not repeat yourself'). Use abstraction as much as is helpful\n",
    "* Clean code is more important than clever code\n",
    "* Document your code - both for others and for yourself\n",
    "* Separation of Concerns (modularisation) - break down your problem into sub-tasks and break down your code into corresponding modules\n",
    "* The structure of your code should reflect the structure of the problem\n",
    "* Avoid premature optimisation - don't spend too much time at the beginning optimising code that may not make it through to the final product\n",
    "\n",
    "Two of the key features of programming are modularisation and abstraction. Functions are a way of encoding general (abstract) relationships that are reusable and help to break down your code into modules. Simple, straightforward functions are easily understood and tested and can act as part of your documentation if the names are understandable\n",

    "Functions operate on data (objects) and can return objects and/or carry out actions (such as the `print` function).  "
