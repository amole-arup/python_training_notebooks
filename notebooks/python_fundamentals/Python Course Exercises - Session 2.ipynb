Create a function called `first_clause()` that returns the first clause of a sentence - i.e. the letters before the first comma e.g. `first_clause('To be or not to be, that is the question.')` -> `'To be or not to be'`. *Hint: searching on Google is always a good way to go, but here you might find it helpful to know that you can return the first element of a list by adding square brackets with the index number zero (representing the first item in a list, counting from zero), e.g. if a list is defined by `a_list = [5,8,3]`, then `a_list[1]` will return `8`.*\n",
    "2. Create a function called `vector_out()` that joins three formatted numbers (3 decimal places) together with commas e.g. `vector_out(2.5441,-4.8269, 2.68591)` -> `'2.544,-4.827,2.686'`. There are multiple ways of doing this."
