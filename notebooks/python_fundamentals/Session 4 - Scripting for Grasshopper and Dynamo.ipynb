    "# Scripting for Rhino, Grasshopper and Dynamo\n",
    "Both Rhino / Grasshopper and Dynamo have embedded versions of Python. These are special versions of Python that were developed based on the Microsoft dotNET platform and are known as [***IronPython***](http://ironpython.net/). There is [documentation available online](https://ironpython-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contents.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Microsoft has begun to support Python more actively, and the most recent versions of Visual Studio include Python Tools for Visual Studio (PTVS). There is an older standalone version that can be added into Visual Studio 2015 Express for Desktop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The version of IronPython that comes with Rhino and Dynamo is v2.7. Details on the differences are available in the [online documentation](https://ironpython-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/whatsnew/2.7.html#python-3-1-features). However, most Python code is compatible across versions 2.7 and 3.x. There are some libraries available in Python 2.7 that allow you to write your code following Python 3 conventions. The change that affects us most was that the Python 2 print function did not have parentheses and using Python 2 print functions will fail in Python 3:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Python 2\n",
    "print \"Hello World\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Python 3\n",
    "print(\"Hello World\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, you can load the `__future__` library in Python 2 and load the `print_function`, and you can then continue to write in the Python 3 format. We would recommend importing both the `print_function` and the `division` modules.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Python 2\n",
    "from __future__ import print_function, division\n",
    "print(\"Hello World\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "The key difference in terms of results is the handling of division of integers. In Python 2, dividing of integers would generate an integer result. In Python 3, the result is automatically returned as a float when necessary. A double 'divide' (`//`) can be used if an integer division is what is required.\n",

    "## IronPython in Rhino / Grasshopper\n",
    "It is important to understand that there are a number of scripting languages in Rhino / Grasshopper: \n",
    "\n",
    "The original scripting language is RhinoScript, which is based on VBScript. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. C#.NET\n",
    "2. VB.NET\n",
    "3. Python\n",
    "\n",
    "McNeel provides a few libraries that can be useful (four of which are listed here). The first two APIs (RhinoCommon and particularly RhinoScriptSyntax) are the main ones that deliver the native functions of Rhino / Grasshopper when you are scripting:\n",
    "1. [RhinoCommon](https://developer.rhino3d.com/api/RhinoCommon/html/R_Project_RhinoCommon.htm) - a low-level software library for creating and manipulating objects in Rhino (not just geometry, but also the interface and the Rhino documents themselves).\n",
    "2. [Rhino.Python RhinoScriptSyntax](https://developer.rhino3d.com/api/RhinoScriptSyntax/) - a high-level library that operates on Rhino Objects - mainly geometry. It is best not to do too much mixing of this library with RhinoCommon as the two use different formats (RhinoScriptSyntax uses GUIDs as references, whereas RhinoCommon uses native dotNET objects themselves).\n",
    "3. [Grasshopper Software Development Kit](https://developer.rhino3d.com/guides/rhinopython/your-first-python-script-in-grasshopper/) - for developing custom components, parameters and data-types for Grasshopper\n",
    "3. [OpenNURBS](https://www.rhino3d.com/opennurbs) - OpenNURBS libraries allow anyone to read and write the 3DM file format without the need for Rhino ([see information online](https://developer.rhino3d.com/guides/opennurbs/what-is-opennurbs/)).\n",
