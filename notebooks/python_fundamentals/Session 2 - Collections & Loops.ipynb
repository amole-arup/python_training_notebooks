    "Collections are groups of data that may be of various types themselves. This allows us to carry out operations on groups of data instead of just individual items, so this is very powerful. The equivalent in Excel is the `Array`, but Excel arrays are quite limited relative to Python collections. Excel VBA provides access to similar collections as provided in Python, so the general principles you learn here will have application to Excel VBA. Note that Excel VBA does not have the 'list comprehension'.\n",

    "**Lists** are a 'collection' data type with fast access to the last item added. Other collections include: \n",
    "* **tuples** - an immutable list that can be used as a key in a dictionary (immutable means that items cannot be changed once the tuple is initialised)\n",
    "* **dictionaries** (or keyed collections) - for storage and rapid lookup of data based on keys\n",
    "* **set** - a sorted list where all entries are unique (if you try to add a duplicate it will be ignored)\n",
    "* **deque** - a linked list where access to either end of the list is fast (access inside the list is slower than a dictionary)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also variations on these, such as:\n",
