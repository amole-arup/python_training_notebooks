    "### Summary of Properties\n",
    "* **Tuples** are immutable (contents can be accessed, but not changed)\n",
    "* **Sequences** are immutable\n",
    "* **NamedTuples** are tuples where the contents are associated with pre-defined names (i.e. key-value pairs)\n",
    "* **Dictionaries** are unordered collections of key-value pairs (keys must be unique)\n",
    "* **Sets** are collections of unique data \n",
    "\n",
    "The main type that we have not introduced yet is the `class` object, and we will not cover it in these sessions. However, you can gain a good understanding of it by starting with the `namedtuple` (note that namedtuples can have functions and properties added to them by means of sub-classing, a form of 'inheritance').\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instantiation (definition)\n",
    "* **Tuples** are defined with the keyword `a_tuple = Tuple(3, 6)` or using the `()` format - `a_tuple = (3,6)`\n",
    "* **NamedTuples** are first defined with the `namedtuple` keyword `e.g. Point2D = namedtuple('Point2D', ['x', 'y'])`, then values are assigned using normal methods for tuples, or using keys - `p = Point2D(11, y=22)`\n",
    "* **Dictionaries** are defined with the keyword, value pairs,  `dict(sape=4139, guido=4127, jack=4098)` or from a list of (key, value) tuples `tel = dict([('sape', 4139), ('guido', 4127), ('jack', 4098)])` or using the `{}` format - `tel = {'jack': 4098, 'sape': 4139}`\n",
    "* **Sets** are defined by curly parentheses `{2,6,7,8}` or with the set() function to convert from other collections (e.g. `set([3, 6, 4, 2, 9, 6, 2])`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Identifying members of the collection\n",
    "* If a value is presented in the form of `value in collection`, then this returns `True` if the value is in the collection, else `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iterating over the collections\n",
    "* It is possible to iterate over these collections - `for item in collection: ...`."
